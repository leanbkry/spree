title: Spree API reference
---

Currently Spree has two REST APIs and in the future we will add GraphQL as well.

## [REST API v2](https://api.spreecommerce.org/docs/api-v2/api/docs/v2/storefront/index.yaml)

* Modern lightweight REST API based on JSON API schema built
* OAuth 2.0 authentication
* Recommended for building Storefronts and mobile apps
* [JavaScript / TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/spree/spree-storefront-api-v2-js-sdk) available

## [REST API v1](/api/v1/summary.html)

* Older REST API that requires API key authentication for access
* Full feature set of Admin Panel
* Recommended for building System integrations

## GraphQL
GraphQL support is coming soon!
